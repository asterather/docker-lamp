This is the basic setup for a LAMP stack using Docker. 
Putting here as backup from VM. setup of docker and docker compose are needed to run this. 
Punctuation and spacing are super important in the .yaml file, errors have been searchable so far.
Looks like I did not put the CLI commands here, that's an oversight to correct moving forward.
SUDO IS A THING
sudo docker-compose up -d to start process
and
sudo docker-compose down to close
